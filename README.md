# PPOp
Ontology for People, Projects, Organizations and what they produce (version 3.1 Nov 22 2021)

This PPOp ontology is designed to help multi-organizional collaborations share information about people, activities and resources. See the SDS-OKN PPOp Schema_v2_Oct10_2021.PNG graphic for an overview of the classes and relationships. A link to a related journal article will be added here as soon as it is available.

The ontology includes some example data (instances) relevant to managing water quality issues in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington, USA. 
Geosparql (spatial) entities for the Puget Sound region are stored as separate files in the PugetSound folder. The main ppop.ttl file calls for their import, but this may have to be done manually depending on the software you use to read the files (and note that not all programs are capable of executing geosparql queries).
